Announced in June 2017, the titles are enhanced versions of Pokémon Sun and Moon with a modified storyline, similar to previous "upper versions" like Yellow, Crystal, Emerald, and Platinum. The games are the second installments in the seventh generation of the main Pokémon RPGs for the Nintendo 3DS as well as the final main-line Pokémon game to be released on the console.</figcaption>
				<figcaption class="image-caption">The games are set in the Hawaii-based Alola region with an alternate storyline and introduce several new characters, Pokémon, forms, and gameplay features. As with previous titles in the series, the game follows a young trainer in a Pokémon-training journey across the region.
